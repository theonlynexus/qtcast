24th July 2009 - 1.0.1 beta 193
===============================

Summary:
--------

 * added static filtering to be.N (to supplement the dynamic filtering)
 * minor change to be.WindowsConsole (to avoid seeming to leak memory, when none is leaked, due to initialisation ordering issues)
 * bundles xTests 0.14.1
 * NOTE: Now requires STLSoft 1.9.86
 * NOTE: These are breaking changes: any programs that use be.N
   must be recompiled and relinked

General:

Core:

 ~ pantheios_printf() will now accept a format string and arguments up to a
   total of 4095 characters.

 ~ pantheios::log() (and all severity-specific logging) will now acquire
   memory from the heap if the total number of characters in the log
   statement is more than 2047, rather than the previous 2048.

Application Layer:

Tracing:

Util:

Front-ends:

Back-ends:

 ~ be.test C++ test API is now in namespace 'pantheios::be::test', rather
   than 'pantheios::test'
 ~ renamed include/backends/bec.test.hpp => include/backends/bec.test.h
 ~ moved implementation of be.test into bec.test library. This means it
   can now be used in conjunction with other back-ends, via be.lrsplit or
   be.N

   NOTE: Only one instance of be.test may be used in any process. Behaviour
   is undefined if two or more instances are used in the same process.

 * Now bundles xTests library for component/unit-testing
 * Updated the error code strings in the Core to reflect recent additions
 * Enhanced pantheios::pointer inserter (Application Layer)
 * Fixed benign (but annoying) bug in time routines (Util)
 * Enhanced functionality of be.COMErrorObject (Back-end)
 * Adjusted all makefiles to build and execute new Unit and Component tests
 * Fixed compilation error in example 10 (Examples)
 * Added/adjusted 4 Unit tests (Test)
 * Added/adjusted 8 Component tests (Test)

Details:
--------

General:

Core:

 ~ updated core/init_error_strings.c to include string forms of
   PANTHEIOS_BE_INIT_RC_ARGUMENT_TOO_LONG and
   PANTHEIOS_BE_INIT_RC_ARGUMENT_OUT_OF_RANGE error codes (added in beta 72)


Application Layer:

 ~ pantheios::pointer now accepts void const volatile*, rather than
   void const*

Tracing:

Util:

 ~ bug whereby calling pantheios_util_getCurrentTime() with NULL to elicit
   required length would give wrong (but larger) length

Front-ends:

Back-ends:

 ~ be.COMErrorObject now recognises PANTHEIOS_BE_INIT_F_NO_SEVERITY

Distribution:

Makefiles / Project-files:

   including new make targets:
    build.test.component, test.component,
    build.test.scratch, test.scratch,
    build.test.unit, test.unit,

   If you type "make test" (or "make -f makefile.unix test"), then you
   will request build and execution of the Unit and Component tests
   only; you will NOT get the Scratch tests, as used to be the case. To
   get the Scratch tests either explicitly type "make test.scratch" or,
   to get all three test types, type "make test.all"

Examples:

 ~ fixed bug in example 10

28th December 2007 - 1.0.1 beta 72
==================================

Summary:
--------

 * Change of back-end initialisation flags and parsing: BREAKING CHANGE!
 * NOTE: These are breaking changes. Any code using any
   stock back-ends may need to be edited!
 * NOTE: *ALL* code using Pantheios must be recompiled, or
   runtime errors may occur!
 * Additional minor adjustments in application layer
 * Additional initialisation error codes defined

Details:
--------

General:

 ~ PANTHEIOS_BE_INIT_F_NO_TIME renamed to PANTHEIOS_BE_INIT_F_NO_DATETIME
 + addition of PANTHEIOS_BE_INIT_RC_ARGUMENT_TOO_LONG (in
   include/pantheios/error_codes.h)
 + addition of added PANTHEIOS_BE_INIT_RC_ARGUMENT_OUT_OF_RANGE (in
   include/pantheios/error_codes.h)

Core:

Application Layer:

 + added include/pantheios/inserters/args.hpp to
   include/pantheios/inserters.hpp

Tracing:

Front-ends:

Back-ends:

 - removal of all back-end specific analogues of the stock back-end argument
   flags, e.g. PANTHEIOS_BE_FILE_F_NO_PROCESS_ID is removed; users should
   now use PANTHEIOS_BE_INIT_F_NO_PROCESS_ID

 ~ fixed erroneous definition of pantheios_be_fprintf_parseArgs

 ~ fixed erroneous definition of pantheios_be_WindowsDebugger_parseArgs

 ~ fixed misspelling of be.speech argument 'speakPunctuation' (was
   'speakPuncutation')

 ~ adjustment of "true" / "false" symbols in back-end argument parsing, to
   support all of true/false, yes/no, on/off, 1/0

 ~ be.WindowsConsole argument parsing now recognises 'showColors' as well as
   'showColours' (as a boon to all the US users <g>)

 ~ be.syslog/be.WindowsSyslog now fully support parsing of arguments 'port',
   'address' and 'facility'

 * reduced size of N-ary Generated Function Templates in Application
   Layer
 * removal of obsolete KiwiSyslog KLOG back-end

Details:
--------

General:

 + include/util/memory/auto_buffer_selector.hpp. Defines the type
   generator template pantheios::auto_buffer_selector, which isolates
   code in the core and in several back-ends from a version change
   in STLSoft 1.9.1 of stlsoft::auto_buffer that reordered the
   template parameters. It's very unlikely that anyone's using STLSoft
   pre-1.9, but best to be sure. Also, the change results in a
   considerable cleanup and removal of pre-processor selection
   statements.
 ~

Makefiles:

Application Layer:

 ~ small refactoring to scripts/make_hdrs.rb, to generate smaller code.
   Results in a 9% saving in include/pantheios/c/log_functions.c. More

Core:

 + PANTHEIOS_CPP_CALL(), used to declare C++-only core functions
 + pantheios_strdup_throw(), pantheios_strdup_nothrow(),
   pantheios_strfree()

Front-ends:

 ~ fixed bug in fe.N, whereby the 0 (backEndId) level would mask
   that of other non-0 (backEndId) levels - i.e. if the 0 level
   is NOTICE and back-end 1's level is DEBUG, the DEBUG and INFO
   output from back-end 1 is never seen
 ~ caches the 0 level once, in front-end initialisation, rather
   than on each call to pantheios_fe_isSeverityLogged()
 ~ tries using the back-end id as the the index of a (non-0)
   back-end; if it does not match, reverts to linear search. If
   the user uses the back-end ids 1, 2, 3, ... in order, indexed
   access (which is faster) will always be used.

Back-ends:

 + pantheios/implicit_link/fe.N.h
 + pantheios/implicit_link/be.N.h
 ~ refactoring of pantheios::internal::Context

5th October 2006 - 1.0.1 beta 4
===============================

Summary:
--------

 * Fixed UNIX/GCC compilation/build issues
 * Added bail-out functionality (to handle init failures)
 * be.syslog Back-end functionality expanded

Details:
--------

Makefiles:

 - removed KLOG targets

 ~ Makefiles that support NOX (NO eXception builds) no longer
   build NOX versions of test programs

 ~ UNIX makefiles:

  + bec.syslog.WithCallback library variant for altering
    SysLog setting via callback.
  + now specify -lpthread, to link in PThreads
  - spurious Windows-specific library references removed
  ~ fix for missing symbols when compiling with GCC
  - removal of GCC/Mac-OSX flag -Wno-long-double for non-Mac
  compilation

Core:

 + pantheios_onBailOut(), a fallback log function that is used
   by the Core (and Front/Back-end(s)) to report on a failure to
   initialise Pantheios. The output facilities are operating
   system-dependent:
    * on UNIX the bail-out message is written to syslog() and to
      the console of the calling process (via fprintf()), and to
      a local file "logging-bailout.txt" (appending if already
      exists)
    * on Windows the bail-out message is written to the debugger
      (via OutputDebugString()), the console (if any) of the
      calling process (via WriteFile()), to a local file
      "logging-bailout.txt" (appending if already exists), and to
      the Windows Event Log (under the source "logging-bailout").

      Note: The Event Log messages will not be correctly formatted
      (although their information will be accessible), unless
      pantheios.COM is installed: The Windows bail-out
      functionality piggy backs on the Event Log message resources
      in pantheios.COM (version 1.0.1 beta 3 or later).

Application Layer:

 ~ pantheios/util/com/exception_helpers.hpp now correctly defined
   for non-exception compilation

Back-ends:

 + be.syslog now supports callbacks, via the pan_be_syslog_init_t
   structure and the pantheios_be_syslog_getAppInit() and
   pantheios_be_syslog_getDefaultAppInit() functions.

 + be.Win32syslog now supports customisation of the facility, via
   the new member 'facility' in the pan_be_Win32syslog_init_t
   structure

 + be.lrsplit uses pantheios_onBailOut() if local and/or remote
   Back-end fail to initialise

Examples:

 ~ fixed examples/cpp/example_cpp_custom_type_1/example_cpp_custom_type_1.cpp
   for compilation with GCC (whose 2-phase lookup is not up
   to scruff)




24th September 2006 - 1.0.1 beta 3
==================================

Makefiles:

 ~ Makefiles that support NOX (NO eXception builds) no longer
  build NOX versions of ACE and KLOG projects, since those
  configurations

 ~ Visual C++ 8 makefile
   + now includes -w4996 to suppress the somewhat silly warnings
     about so-called "safe" functions
   - single-threaded variants no longer specify the obsolete
     compiler flags -ML / -MLd

Core:

 + pantheios_getSeverityStringLength()

 + string access shims for the pan_severity_t type

 ~ pantheios_getNextBackEndId() now implemented in terms of a
   mutex (platformstl::process_mutex) when compiling on a
   platform that does not provide an atomic_preincrement()
   function.

Application Layer:

 ~ changes to all log()/log_XXXX() function templates to use
   "using declarations" rather than explicit qualification of the
   string access shim functions, in order to cover up a problem
   that GCC has in its ADL (argument-dependent lookup).

 ~ pantheios::blob() now does 1-grouping when the two-parameter
   constructor is used.

pantheios::com:

 + more function overloads




2nd September 2006 - 1.0.1 beta 2
=================================

There have been myriad small changes, and some breaking changes, to
previous non-public releases of Pantheios (and its preceeding
proprietary Synesis Software incarnation). However, they're way too
many to list here, and those who have those previous non-public
versions are sufficiently in the know (including my phone number)
that there's no need to enumerate the differences here.

To all intents and purposes, this is the first public release of
Pantheios. From here on in, it gets interesting ....
